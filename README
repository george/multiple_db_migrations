rake db:create:all

(or to start from scratch: rake db:drop:all db:create:all)

rake db:migrate

Then look at db/development.sqlite3 and db/development_b.sqlite3

Note: Migration metadata is stored in the "primary" database

Note: schema.rb only shows the schema of the "primary" database

Note: rake db:test:load may not work out of the box
